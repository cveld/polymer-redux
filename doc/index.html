            <p>
                Some time ago I realised that the two best things currently out
                there, <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/rackt/redux">Redux</a>, were not yet used
                together. So I decided to dig into this and prove
                that they work great together!

                I mist admit that <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a
                    href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> are great
                frameworks too, but why invent a whole new concepts, while the DOM itself has a lot of framework type
                concepts
                just built into it:

            <ol>
                <li>Component model (custom element)</li>
                <li>Concept of data flow (attributes/properties and events)
                <li>declarative syntax (HTML)</li>
            </ol>

            Anyway, this is not a post about Polymer :) <br><br>

            Below I'll explain how I use a single store, no two-way data-binding, actions and reducers!

            <h2>Single source of truth</h2>

            <p class="first-dark-blue">
                Having just one state object is awesome. I especially realised this when I tried to save the current
                state to <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.
